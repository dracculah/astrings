# astrings
Better strings for C++

* it's meant to be very forgiving about out of bounds errors, though still contain consistency
* it's meant to be user intuitive as a replacement as a string-alike class
* it's meant to be able to substring very easily without iterators and whatnot
* it's meant to bring the joy of python string indexing like negatives to count from the end
* it's meant to tolerate both start_from_0_indices and start_from_1_indices, except operator[]
